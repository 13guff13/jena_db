  <name>Apache Jena - Shadowed external libraries</name>
  <description>
    This module shadows some external libraries like Guava, 
    which we don't want to be depending on in their regular
    package names, as they are likely to change/upgrade
    externally and also be used in other libraries 
    in potentially conflicting versions.

    This module uses the Shade plugin to re-package them
    under the package name
    org.apache.jena.ext and is also a valid OSGi bundle.
    This module should only be used internally by other 
    Jena modules.
