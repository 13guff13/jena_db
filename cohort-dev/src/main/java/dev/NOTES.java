    //   Single writer
    
    // Delayed write back by leaving stuff in the journal.

    // Promotable transactions:
    //    Two counters, writer leading and trailing edge.
    //    R transactions note their start generation.
    //    Can promote IFF that is still the generation at the point of promotion.
