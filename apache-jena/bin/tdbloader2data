tdbloader2data - TDB Bulk Loader - Data Phase

Usage tdbloader2data --loc <Directory> [Options] <Data> ...

Bulk Loader for TDB which generates the Node Table.  This command
relies on POSIX utilities so will only work on POSIX operating
systems.

This command can only be used to create new database. If you wish to
bulk load to an existing database please use tdbloader instead.

Required options are as follows:

  -l <DatabaseDirectory>
  --loc <DatabaseDirectory>
    Sets the location in which the database should be created.

    This location must be a directory and must be empty, if a
    non-existent path is specified it will be created as a new
    directory.

  <Data>
    Specifies the path to one/more data files to load

Common additional options are as follows:

  -h
  --help
    Prints this help summary and exits

Advanced additional options are as follows:

  -d
  --debug
    Enable debug mode, adds extra debug output

  -k
  --keep-work
    Keeps the temporary work files around after they are no longer
    needed.  May be useful for debugging.

  -t
  --trace
    Enable trace mode, essentially sets -x within the scripts
